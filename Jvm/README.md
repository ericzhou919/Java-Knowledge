# Java Virtual Machine

The JVM provides Java with cross-platform capability, security, memory management, and automatic garbage collection features.

The compiler creates .class files when we compile .java files. These contain bytecode and have the same class names as the .java files. When we run .class files, JVM executes the following operations:  
- Loads bytecode
- Verifies bytecode
- Executes bytecode
- Provides a runtime environment to support various applications

JVM also helps in managing and optimizing resources during program execution by defining:
- Memory area
- Register set
- Garbage collection
- Class file format
- Reporting fatal errors
